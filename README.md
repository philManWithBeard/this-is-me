## Description
“I want my MP to know how many of their constituents are getting priced out of housing each year!”
We are Introducing THIS IS ME - Empowering Advocacy for Affordable Housing app. Our web app provides a dynamic visualisation of past house prices and average annual pay increases within counties. With data-driven insights, constituents can email the urgency of affordable housing to local MPs directly from our app. Join us in activating the change for our community's future.

## Usage
A tool for citizens to visualise and act on the data on UK house costs against average salaries in the area from the year 2000 to the present day. The charts will display the rising disparity between the two metrics very clearly - this then, with a personalised contact form, will let parliamentary member be aware of the exact sentiment and data of their constituents on the topic of housing affordability.
