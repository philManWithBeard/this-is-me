## Description
A data-driven participatory tool was created by We Are Us.
This-Is-Me is a tool that helps people see and use data on local house prices compared to average local salaries. Users can also compare current data with past data. A form collects users' lived experiences. You can get the housing data, make it personal to you, and send it over to your MP in one convincing argument. The app uses it to inform MPs about how their constituents feel. The features include two different API calls coordinated to return the stats and details we needed,  rapid development with React Hook Form., and animated data visualisation. A unique dataset was stored and retrieved from Sanity.io using GraphQL. Google Pagespeed scores have been marked as good.
